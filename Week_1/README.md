# Binary Reverse Engineering
The primary focus for this week is to become comfortable with reverse engineering programs by disassembling them, looking at their assembly, and figuring out what it does. We will be working with 2 Binary Bombs, one from CMU and another from RPI. Along with these bombs, we will be working with some PWNABLES from pwnable.kr.

In order to work on these some people may need to brush up on their assembly and their tools. We have put together some resources to help by categories.
